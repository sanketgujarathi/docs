Creational Patterns -
Builder - Build the object step-by-step, return same instance in every step. 
			StringBuilder/StringBuffer, using the append() method, is an example of BuilderPattern. URI builder
			http://www.codejava.net/coding/how-to-use-builder-pattern-for-designing-method-parameters
			Extensively used in setup of junit tests,facilitate building objects to be tested selectively. Improves testability.
Factory -  Provides method that return an implementation of an abstract/interface type. 
			Calendar.getInstance(),SessionFactory.openSession(), Spring beanfactory is an example of Factory pattern
AbstractFactory - Provides method that return the factory itself which in turn can be used to create another abstract/interface type.(Factory of factoryclasses)
			Hibernate "new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory()" is an example of AbstractFactory pattern
Singleton - Provides a method that always returns the same instance of the class. 
			Runtime is an example of Singleton class
Prototype - Provides a method that returns different instance with the same properties. 
			Object.clone() is an example of Prototype pattern(Object return copy of itself and modify accordingly)

Behavioural Pattern - 
Iterator pattern - sequentially traverse through objects of same type and return them one by on. Methods - hasNext(), next() and remove(). Iterator on collections
Strategy pattern - which invokes a method in an implementation of a different abstract/interface type which has been passed-in as method argument into the strategy implementation. The intent of the Strategy Pattern is to make the algorithms easily interchangeable, and provide a means to choose the appropriate algorithm at a particular time.Comparator.compare is example of Strategy pattern
Command pattern - Lets you encapsulate actions within Java classes, where each class has an "execute()" method which is declared in the Command interface the class implements.The object that invokes the operation is decoupled from the object that knows how to perform the action. E.g - Runnable
Chain of responsibility - invokes the same method in another implementation of same abstract/interface type in a queue. E.g - Filter.dofilter()
Structural Patterns -
Flyweight - Share data/returning a cached instance to save memory. string pool/Wrapper classes is example of Flyweight pattern.
Decorator - take instance of same type and add additional behaviour. Wrapper classes is example of decorator.Response object class created from model class with added information of jaxb for marshalling
Adapter  - take instance of another abstract/interface and acts as a convertor i.e. provides a new interface for an incompatible client. toString method
Proxy - Returns implementation of type which internally delegates/uses a different implementation AOP, reflection
Facade - Simplified abstraction layer
Composite - 
Bridge - The primary function of bridge pattern is to decouple an abstraction from its implementation.

Differences between patterns - 
A builder is used when you need to do lot of things to build an object. A factory is used when the facatory can easily create the entire object within one method call.

Interview Questions

why interface variables are public static final? 
final - to force initialization, since no constructor. Any implementations can change value of fields if they are not defined as final. Then they would become a part of the implementation.
static since can't be instance hence all variables need to be shared. 
public - private makes no sense no instance and no instance methods etc. 

package java.util. Date,calendar, collection classes

package java.lang String,StringBuffer,StringBuilder, Object

Class java.lang.Object

Comparator - older, more common interface, can be used to define only one way of sorting 

Comparable -newer interface, used to define various sorting parameters, 3rd party/legacy classes, can avoid null pointer issues

When does ConcurrentModificationException occur, how to avoid?Occurs when size changes. use iterator.remove() or ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList classes.

What is IdentityHashMap? Uses == instead of .equals() 

autoboxing/unboxing - autoconversion provided by java between primitive types and their wrapper classes. Wrapper classes are required for using in collections and using with generics. Disadv - primitives  are lightweight as compared to wrapper classes.

Marker interface - serializable, clonable

how do you ensure that you are deserializing only serialize able class ? -using instance of

difference between application server and webserver

how to make singleton class (inner class method is simple easy to understand method doesn't require synchronization )

why framework? - provides certain common functionalities that would be required to build enterprise application. Provides already tested code.

How does java facilitate loose coupling and tight cohesion? loose coupling - abstraction, tight cohesion - encapuslation, access specifiers

Difference between abstraction and composition?

Hierarchy of exceptions?

How does class loader work? When does noclassdeferror occur? Not present in classpath or exception thrown during static initialization
ClassNotFoundException comes when JVM tries to load a class at runtime dynamically means you give the name of class at runtime and then JVM tries to load it and if that class is not found in classpath it throws java.lang.ClassNotFoundException. While in case of NoClassDefFoundError the problematic class was present during Compile time and that's why program was successfully compile but not available during runtime by any reason
Soln -  Verify that all required Java classes are included in the application’s classpath. The most common mistake is not to include all the necessary classes, before starting to execute a Java application that has dependencies on some external libraries. The classpath of the application is correct, but the Classpath environment variable is overridden before the application’s execution. Verify that the aforementioned ExceptionInInitializerError does not appear in the stack trace of your application.

Instance Variables: These variables are serialized, so while deserialization we will get back the serialized state.

Static Variables: These variables are not serialized, So while deserialization static variable value will loaded from the class.(Current value will be loaded.)

transient Variables: transient variables are not serialized, so while deserialization those variables will be initialized with corresponding default values (ex: for objects null, int 0).

Super class variables: If super class also implemented Serializable interface then those variables will be serialized, otherwise it won't serialize the super class variables. and while deserializing, JVM will run default constructor in super class and populates the default values. Same thing will happen for all superclasses.

transient with static - does not affect since both are not persisted anyways
transient with final - not a compilation error, but problem arises while deserialization since value cannot be assigned to final variable.
serializing singleton - implement readObject and return the same instance to avoid breaking singleton pattern.

primitive types are more specific as compared to wrapper classes for overloading.
String pool -
stored in heap, before java 7 stored in perm gen
http://www.xyzws.com/javafaq/what-is-string-literal-pool/3
To force string pooling on string object use "string".intern()
String e = "Test";
String f = new String("Test").intern();
// comparing the Strings as objects & not the value
System.out.println(e==f);//true

Example of static inner class - Used for creating a Rowmapper for using with spring jdbc template.

Difference between Tomcat and Weblogic server - 
Tomcat is a Servlet/JSP container. It is free. It does not support the Java EE 6 container features such as EJB/JPA out of the box. These can be integrated but will not be equivalent to a proper EJB container.

WebLogic Server is a fully loaded EJB container. It has the best server and database connection pooling features in the market. It is easy to build/deploy/debug apps on Weblogic. It's a commercial product and quite expensive at that.
EJB container provide security, transaction management, object pooling features

Difference EJB and Spring /Are EJB/Spring different implementations of Java EE?- 
No, as said, EJB is part of Java EE. Spring is a standalone framework which substitutes and improves many parts of Java EE. Spring doesn't necessarily require Java EE to run. A barebones servletcontainer like Tomcat is already sufficient. Simply put, Spring is a competitor of Java EE. E.g. "Spring" (standalone) competes EJB/JTA, Spring MVC competes JSF/JAX-RS, Spring DI/IoC/AOP competes CDI, Spring Security competes JAAS/JASPIC, etc

***Threading***
ThreadLocal - Each thread has its own copy. Static, final (Not mandatory, but recommended). Usually used with Singleton beans.

Deadlocks
- When two threads call Thread.join() on each other.
- When two threads use nested synchronised blocks to lock two objects and the blocks lock the same objects in different order

***Spring***
Difference between IoC and DI?
Inversion of control is the principle where the control flow of a program is inverted: instead of the programmer controlling the flow of a program, the external sources (framework, services, other components) take control of it.
Eg - Servlet API defines init service and destroy methods. You don't get to control when these methods are called, just what they do. The container calls us, we don't call it.
DI is a type of IoC.
This means that objects do not create other objects on which they rely to do their work. Instead, they get the objects that they need from an outside source
In short, IoC is a much broader term that includes, but is not limited to, DI

Any adv/disadvantage of using xml based spring config over annotation - 
Annotations are simpler as compared to the more tedious xml config, convenient to use because of autowiring, present in the class itself so more visibility(about which members are injected externally) for developer, wiring can be done while creating class itself so less chances of missing out on wiring any member. Disadv -  annotations cannot be used for third party classes (classes from a jar),

Role of spring framework apart from DI - 
It also manages lifecycle of beans. Spring IoC you can configure the number of instances of the component – whether the component is a singleton or not – and at what point the component is created and destroyed in memory.

How does aop work

What type of ioc have you used? adv disadvantage of constructor and setter injections


What is autowiring?

Why not to use autowiring used? How to enable autowiring. - 
In case of big projects while debugging some complex issues then all information present in one place in configuration files, actually helps a lot. Autowiring makes debugging harder since it is less obvious.
Autowiring simplifies DI by abstracting the details. However in complex projects with many implementations of the same interface, this could create difficulties as the injection details are not obvious.

What are design patterns used in spring? 
Factory pattern in beanfactory, proxy pattern used in AOP	

Which modules / special feature of Spring framework used? dependency injection, AOP, transaction management, custom annotation

****Spring Transaction Management****
When using JPA outside of a dependency injection container, transactions need to be handled programatically by the developer
This way of managing transactions makes the scope of the transaction very clear in the code, but it has several disavantages:
    it's repetitive and error prone
    any error can have a very high impact
    errors are hard to debug and reproduce
    this decreases the readability of the code base
    What if this method calls another transactional method?
Managing transactions declaratively by using @Transactional, many important aspects such as transaction propagation are handled automatically.One potential downside is that this powerful mechanism hides what is going on under the hood, making it hard to debug when things don't work.

how would you write junits

which collection types used? List(for collection of objects), maps( when only one object from the collection would be required) and sets ( multiple occurences of objects could occur hence used sets to keep collection unique)

what is mvc

Reason for soap over rest?
SOAP - SOAP relies on XML (Extensible Markup Language) in three ways; 
the Envelope – that defines what is in the message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for datatypes, and finally the layout of the procedure calls and responses gathered. 
This envelope is sent via a transport (HTTP/HTTPS), and an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is executed and the envelope is returned with information in a XML formatted document.

-Formal contracts
-Stateful. SOAP requires less plumbing code than REST services design, (i.e., transactions, security, coordination, addressing, trust, etc.) Most real-world applications are not simple and support complex operations, which require conversational state and contextual information to be maintained. 
-SOAP Web services (such as JAX-WS) are useful in handling asynchronous processing and invocation.


Reason for rest over soap?
REST approach - which uses a standard URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that makes a call to a web service.
The approach is very simple to understand and can be executed on really any client or server that has HTTP/HTTPS support.
-Limited bandwidth and resources since it is lightweight, doesn't require rich clients that need to consume wsdls
-stateless
-can use XML or JSON, which is lightweight as compared to XML
-since stateless, caching is easier
-the ease of development, use of the existing web infrastructure, and little learning overhead 

**
PATCH v/s PUT
The difference between the PUT and PATCH requests is reflected in the way the server processes the enclosed entity to modify the resource identified by the Request-URI. In a PUT request, the enclosed entity is considered to be a modified version of the resource stored on the origin server, and the client is requesting that the stored version be replaced. With PATCH, however, the enclosed entity contains a set of instructions describing how a resource currently residing on the origin server should be modified to produce a new version. The PATCH method affects the resource identified by the Request-URI, and it also MAY have side effects on other resources; i.e., new resources may be created, or existing ones modified, by the application of a PATCH.

When to use and when not to use DI? 
Use DI for decoupling logic like DAO implementation, otherwise use new operator

Team size? How is the work assigned? 

What automation used in SDLC lifecyle?

Improve performance?
Reduce IO operations - eg loading of schemas. Changed prototype to singleton.
Reduce database calls - identified calls made repeatedly during a single execution and introduced caching.

Short term goals?

Any achievements?
Appreciation from client for the way demo and test evidences were presented.
Appreciation for the analysis work to improve performance of ES component.

What are the design patters used in project?
Factory pattern - Multiple implementations of an abstract class present. Factory class return appropriate implementation depending on the message type given as input.
Decorator pattern - Decorator class created from model class with added information of marshalling to entity beans to XML/JSON
Adapter pattern - Bankapi provided a unified interface for number of underlying web services that provided various core banking functionalities
Builder pattern - Build dom objects for xml
context pattern - A context is a collection of data, often stored in a Map or a custom class which acts as a structure with accessors and modifiers. It is used for maintaining state and for sharing information within a system. Another example for it might be HttpSession object: you have a attributes which is basically a map with String keys and Object elements. This provides state information between http requests. Another example is ServletRequest which provides state information between Servlets.



What is your role?
1. Design - what artifacts used?
2. Configuration of project - ?
3. Testing - L3 testing using JUnits, Fitnesse/SOAP UI on dev environment
4. Deployment - Release related activities - release notes, backout plans
5. Production support - Provided dedicated production support to whenever major functionalities went live.

***Hibernate***
Hibernate configurations - 
All hibernate.* properties are loaded into the Configuration object when it is created.
SessionFactory sessionFactory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory(); 
When configure() is called, the classpath is searched for an XML configuration file called hibernate.cfg.xml. 
hibernate transactions

void saveOrUpdate(object)->object must be attached to a hibernate session (including all sub objects within the object), and once save/update is done, the object reflects the updated changes (e.g. primary key if saving a new object)

Object merge(object)-> object does not have to be attached to a hibernate session.  Once save/update is done, the object DOES NOT reflect the change.  The returned object reflects the changes, and it is attached to hibernate session.MERGE method offers greater flexibility when it comes to saving data objects, since you need not worry about attaching object to Session.
You can create an object, set Id, and other properties on your own, and save it without worrying about the Hibernate Session exception.
If you’re using saveOrUpdate, the object saved MUST be attached to session.  I believe many people have experienced this issue.
This means you can create a copy of object from Service layer and just pass the object to your DAO.  Hibernate takes care of MERGING the data to appropriate hibernate session attached object and saves the data.
The only downside of using MERGE is that the object passed does not reflect the changed information.  So, if you need to use the updated object, you must get it from the returned object, not the parameter object.

Reattaching objects - 
update - An entity can be reattached using update only if there is no other JVM object (matching the same database row) already associated to the current Hibernate Session. Otherwise throws NonUniqueObjectException
Merging - The merge is going to copy the detached entity state (source) to a managed entity instance (destination). It uses the object identifiers to check on this existence. If the merging entity has no equivalent in the current Session, one will be fetched from the database. The detached object instance will continue to remain detached even after the merge operation.

How prepared statement prevents sql injection?
http://www.programmerinterview.com/index.php/database-sql/example-of-prepared-statements-and-sql-injection-prevention/
In case of prep stat, query(with a ?) and params are sent to database separately, query is compiled and optimized (only once) and then executed using the parameter. Thus the injected malicious sql statement is consider only as a string and not compiled and executed as a separate sql statement.

When to use inverse and cascade?
http://www.java4s.com/hibernate/hibernate-one-to-many-bidirectional-mapping-example/
Inverse attribute is always present in one-to-many and many-to-many relationship and it denotes which side is responsible to for the relationship. It’s default value is false
Use inverse=true for bi-directional relationships so we can save either parent or child and all get saved
Inverse attribute is always present in one-to-many and many-to-many relationship and it denotes which side is responsible to for the relationship. It’s default value is false
Student {
@OneToMany(inverse = false)
Set<Project> finalYearProjects;
}
Here Project is the parent and responsible for maintaining the foreign key.  If you want to add a new “couple” to the relationship, you have to add a Student instance to the Project's student attribute. And again, if you want to delete a “couple” of the relationship you have to null the student attribute of the Project class.
If inverse is true Student is the owner.

Hibernate Detached state?
http://www.hibernate-training-guide.com/detached-state.html
The Detached state may seem odd at first glance, but it provides an incredibly powerful capability to applications.
Applications could not (or should not) typically maintain long running transactions or connections to a database. The Detached state allows Java objects to exist and to be used, but without a long running session/transaction.

***Maven***

What are maven goals used to run the project?

what are different maven plugins used? - assembly - making tar files surefire - junit reports cobertura - code coverage etc

what is Automated Continuous Integration and why is it awesome? - Automates the build process. Ensures that every commit results in a stable code base. Ensures downstream projects are not affected

Maven vs Ant
1. Well defined conventions. Familarity helps new team members to understand project structure and config. we can easily move between Maven projects without bothering much about the builds whereas in Ant projects, we need to spend some extra time with build files to know the configuration and the flow. It is often said, you see a mall and you have seen them all, similarly once you build a Maven project, you can manage any Maven project. 
2. Less configuration. Since Maven predefines majority of the build process there is less to configure and in size. It’s some thing like this: when it comes to Ant, you have to setup the entire build system whereas in Maven as long as you follow conventions, experts have already setup the build system for you.

example of  maven scopes- 
	compile(needed during both compile and runtime) - spring,hibernate. For a web application, as an example, the JAR will be placed in the WEB-INF/lib directory. 
	provided(needed only during compile time, expected to be provided at runtime by environment)  - For e.g servlet-api jar is added as a dependency with provided scope. servlet-api.jar is a transient dependency in my web project and is needed both at compile time and runtime. But servlet-api.jar is also included in my Tomcat library. so it doesn't need to be included in the war file. 
	Provided scope is only needed at compile time but is not packaged in your app cause it is provided by others, for example it is already in Tomcat server.  For a web app, this means that the JAR file will not be placed into the WEB-INF/lib directory. 
	test - mockito/junit
	runtime (needed only during runtime)- a JDBC driver can be loaded with a Class.forName and the actual class loaded be configurable through a configuration file.
	
How to create multi module maven project?
1. Set <packaging> as pom in parent pom
2. List the modules in <modules> in parent pom
3. Common dependencies can be added to parent pom
4. Add a <parent> section in the child project pom to reference the parent project, which is now the parent project.

What is dependency exclusion ?
Any transitive dependency can be exclude using "exclusion" element. As example, A depends upon B and B depends upon C then A can mark C as excluded.

prod issue - 
1. null pointer exception in prod,pattern matching failed in string because of a extra space(pattern had the check + instead of *). 
cause - difference between test data and production data
2. Object was not deleted from set because it's value was changed hence its hashcode changed and was not found.
3. Changing bean scope from prototype to singleton for class which does I/O operation for loading schema files. This resulted in significant performance improvements.


***JavaMessageService***

JMS is a message oriented middleware used for integration by providing APIs for applications to communicate with each other.
Used to process long-running operations asynchronously.Since it is not practical to wait for long times in a web application
-Loosely coupled - applications do not communicate with each other directly
-Flexibility - n/w not available or application is not running
-Asynchronous - producer/consumer do not block each other while sending/receive messages.

Pub/Sub - 
- Topics instead of queues
- Multiple publishers/subscribers for a topic

ConnectionFactory > Connection > Session
Session - createMessage() (bytes,text,map object),createProducer(), createConsumer()	

A message broker provides a programming environment where you can write message transformation code easily and efficiently.


***Servlet****
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3106452/how-do-servlets-work-instantiation-session-variables-and-multithreading/3106909#3106909
Servlet config explanation 
http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-servlets/web-xml.html
        Enumeration contextParams = getServletContext().getInitParameterNames();	//context-param, values which can be read from all servlets in your application
		Enumeration initParams = getServletConfig().getInitParameterNames();  		//Init-param, init parameters of a servlet can only be accessed by that servlet
The number inside the <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup> element tells the servlet container in what sequence the servlets should be loaded. 
The lower numbers are loaded first. If the value is negative, or unspecified, the servlet container can load the servlet at any time. 

//...
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-cache"); //Forces caches to obtain a new copy of the page from the origin server
response.setHeader("Cache-Control","no-store"); //Directs caches not to store the page under any circumstance
response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); //Causes the proxy cache to see the page as "stale"
response.setHeader("Pragma","no-cache"); //HTTP 1.0 backward compatibility
//can check userId or something likes this.In this sample, i checked with userName.
String userName = (String) session.getAttribute("User");
if (null == userName) {
request.setAttribute("Error", "Session has ended.  Please login.");
RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher("login.jsp");
rd.forward(request, response);


***JUnit****
@Before methods run before each @Test method
Used for setup/initialization
@After methods run after each @Test method
Used for cleanup. For e.g. destroy ehcache manager. since only one is allowed in vm
Mocking frameworks used - mockito and powermock
Powermock allows mocking private methods by creating partial mocks

****JBPM****
3.  What is JBPM?
jBPM is a flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite.
The core of jBPM is a light-weight, extensible workflow engine written in pure Java that allows you to execute business processes using the latest BPMN 2.0 specification. It can run in any Java environment, embedded in your application or as a service.

4.  What does jBPM do?
This business process allows you to model your business goals by describing the steps that need to be executed to achieve that goal and the order, using a flow chart.
This greatly improves the visibility and agility of your business logic, results in higher-level and domain-specific representations that can be understood by business users and is easier to monitor.

5. Mention the main features of JBPM5?
Visual user friendly editor: Eclipse plugin. 
BPMN2 standard support: This allows you to choose a different editor to generate your business processes and run them in JBPM5.
Human Task features: JBPM5 has a native notion of a Human task, an activity that needs to be completed by an actual person and has a lifecycle: it can be started, suspended, completed, etc. It is also a standard spec.
JPA persistence method: it enables you to choose any database and persistence schema to store the processes variables and history log.
Powerful rules language: To make decisions within the process you can use Drools rule syntax to for example change a path according to a business condition, such as a credit score.

8.  What is a rule engine?
A rule engine may be viewed as a sophisticated if/then statement interpreter. The if/then statements that are interpreted are called rules.

9.  What are the advantages of Rule engine?
Advantages of Rule Engines:
Greater flexibility: keeping your rules into a Knowledge base let you adapt easily your decisions when they are changing.
Easier to grasp: Rules are easier to understand than procedural code so they can be effectively used to bridge the gap between business analyst and developers.
Reduced complexity: When embedding lots of decision points to your procedural codes it can easily turn your application into a nightmare. On the other hand rules can handle much better increasing complexity because they use a consistent representation of business rules.
Reusability: By keeping rules are kept in one place leads to a greater reusability of your business rules. Also, traditional procedural code often impose unnecessary variations of base rules which are therefore more difficult to reuse in other contexts

10.  What is global in DRL file?
Global is the keyword used in drools to define a global variable. Global variable is the one which will be visible to all the rules inside a DRL file.
Globals must be used very carefully in a DRL file, since the changes in a global variable are not notified to the working memory. For example, you are using a list variable as a global and in any rule you are adding a value in a list and in one particular rule, you are checking if list size() > 0, then in this case rule may not fire. Global variable can be used for any type of object.

11.  Where to use global variable?
Consider a scenario, where in the rules there is a requirement for database connection object. In this case, the DB Connection object can be inserted as a global variable in the working memory and the connection object will be visible to all the rules in that DRL file.

*******Reflection****
Reflection should be avoided for the following reasons:

    Things break easily during refactorings, since statical types, method and field names are replaced by strings that typically don't participate in refactorings

    Reflection can be used to break encapsulation, e.g. to access private fields; will break when internals change

    Often hard to read & not straight forward to comprehend

None the less, there are situations where usage of reflection is required and justified, e.g.:

    writing code analyzers/annotation processors

    writing a plugin framework
*****************Garbage collection*************
Memory divided into 2 areas - heap and perm gen(method area)
Perm gen - 
	Method area, information about loaded classes, string pool (before java 7) and object meta data
	The size of the permanent generation is controlled by two JVM parameters. -XX:PermSize sets the minimum, or initial, size of the permanent generation, and -XX:MaxPermSize sets the maximum size.
Heap -
	All objects are stored in Heap. 
	Configured using above the heap size is -Xms at minimum and -Xmx at maximum.
	It is further divided into two areas -
		New/Young gen - 
			New objects are created in Eden.
			GC occurs most frequently here.
			Young gen divided into one Eden space and two Survivor spaces
			
			Copy collection algo-
			Step 1:(‘Copy’) it will copy the objects we still need  into a ‘survivor’ space. There are two survivor spaces and they are smaller than eden in size. 
			Step 2: Now that all the objects we want to keep are safe in the survivor space, it can simply delete everything in eden, and it is done.
			Adv: No fragmentation
			Disadv:This causes "stop the world" pause where all running threads are paused. For large memory like 8GB it could take minutes.
			Used where number of live objects are less (Eden)
			
			Mark-Sweep-Compact Collection algo-
			Step 1: (‘Mark’), it marks the unused objects
			Step 2: (‘Sweep’), it deletes those objects from memory.
			Step 3: (‘Compact’), it moves objects to ‘fill up the gaps,’ thus leaving the largest amount of contiguous memory available in case a large object is created.
			
			Used where number of live objects are more(Old gen)

		Old/Tenured gen -
			Objects in eden move to the old generation when the objects you need to keep are bigger than the survivor space.
			
**************************Scalabitlity**********************
How to make applications scalable?
Following approches should be taken up one by one as workload increases
1. Application server
Multiple instances of application on identical servers behind a load balancer. This load balancer evenly balances load(requests)
 on to your group of application servers. The request should always return the same results irrespective of the the server it landed on. Every server should run the same code and does not store any user-related data, like sessions on local disc or memory. Sessions need to be stored in a centralized data store which is accessible to all your application servers.
 
2. Database
Denormalize the database so that there are no more joins in any database query. Eventually use a nosql database. This will allow you to store terabytes of data without pain.

3. Cache
Store the result dataset of a query in a cache. A hash representation of your query is the cache key. The next time you run the same query first check if it is already in the cache.

4. Asynchornism
Use job queues using JMS like ActiveMQ


*********************Messaging v/s Web Services*****************
I will use web services when -
1. Dealing with cross domain, typically services enironment when we are not sure of client technology
2. Need synchronous response.
	* If the server fails the client must take responsibilty to handle the error.
	* When server is running again, client is responsible for resending the request.
	* If the server sends a response and the client fails the operation is lost.
	* You can expect immediate response from server, but the you can handle asynchronous calls too.
	
And pick up messaging when - 
1. Message queues are ideal for request that take long time to process.
2. High availability
3. Confirmed delivery
	* If the server fails the queue will store the message
	* When the server is running again it will receive the pending messages.
	* If the server gives respone to the client and the client fails and does not acknowledge the response the message is persisted.
